# TicTacToe ASP

The large majority of logical component of the project was completed in my first year at University. The UI aspect was completed after my first coop term. Although I firmly believe in the ability of the AI to always choose the best possible option without being predictable, I do acknowledge that many areas can be improved in regards to coding convention. Being young and inexperienced at the time and also doing this project solely for self enjoyment, I did not put much emphasis on readability and maintainability of the code for other people. When coding as part of a team I make it my #1 priority to follow all coding conventions set by the team, following naming conventions, making my code as easy to understand as possibile, easily maintainable, scalable, highly organized with logical order, refactoring code into seperate functions when necessary and other steps regarding producing the best code for the community.
